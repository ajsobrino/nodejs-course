## NodeJS to TypeScript

NodeJS is a light language programming because this does not have type strong variables and other thing. Then you can work with **Typscript** and compile to JS for run with **NodeJS**.

In this proyect we use typescript and MySql for run with nodeJS.
If you want to start the proyect, you only throw for command line the setence **npm install** and **npm start** for boot the server.
